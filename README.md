Web Fundamentals [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/google/WebFundamentals.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/google/WebFundamentals)
================

Web Fundamentals is a technical documentation center for multi-device web
development.  Our goal is to build a resource for modern web developers
thatâ€™s as curated and thorough as developer.android.com or iOS Dev Center.

Content plan
------------
Content plan for Web Fundamentals is tracked through GitHub Issues and our [Site Structure + Content Inventory](http://goo.gl/nWDD0M) doc


Release status
--------------

The project was soft launched in late April with a formal v1 launch in June 2014.  We've now moved to a six-week rolling release cycle.

Technology
----------

This is a Jekyll build.

```
/appengine - the server to host the static content
/src - the documentation
  /_langs - the content in each language
    /en - the base language folder
      /getting-started - the getting started articles
      /multi-device-layouts - responsive design guide
      /introduction-to-media - the guide to using media
      /optimizing-performance - the perf articles
      /using-touch - managing touch
      /showcase - the case-studies
      ...etc...
    /<langcode> - overrides for that language, following the main path structure.
```

The site is generated in `/appengine/build`, but is never checked in.

Installing Dependencies
=======================

Docker (recommended)
--------------------
1. Download and install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/installation/) for your platform.
1. Now it's installed check out the [Running the site section for Docker](https://github.com/google/webfundamentals#running-the-site) below.

**Note:** Googlers - You may need to complete a few extra steps, ask for more details.


Mac
---

1. Install [Xcode Command Line Tools](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/downloads/)
1. Install [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)
    * `curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.23.3/install.sh | bash`
1. Install node 0.10.x
    * `nvm install 0.10`
    * `nvm use 0.10`
1. Install [RVM](https://rvm.io/rubies/default)
    * `curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash`
1. Set RVM Default to 2.2.0
    * `rvm install ruby-2.2.0`
    * `rvm --default use 2.2.0`
1. Install [Pygments](http://pygments.org/)
    * `sudo easy_install pygments`
1. Install [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/) dependencies ([Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and [Kramdown](http://kramdown.gettalong.org/))
    * `gem install bundler`
    * `rvm . do bundle install`
1. Install the [Grunt CLI](http://gruntjs.com/)
    * `npm install -g grunt-cli`
1. Install [npm](https://www.npmjs.org) dependencies
    * `npm install`
1. Install fontforge if required for grunt-webfont on your OS.  See [grunt-webfont installation instructions](https://github.com/sapegin/grunt-webfont/blob/master/Readme.md#installation) for details.
1. Get the [App Engine SDK](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/downloads) and unzip into the google_appengine folder inside the project root. Add it to your path accordingly (in bash, `$ PATH=./google_appengine:$PATH`)

**Note:** On OSX, you may see an error about *Warning: EMFILE, too many open files*.
If so you will need to increase the maximum number of open file handles.  
Use `ulimit -n 1024` to increase the maximum number of open files to 2048 from
the default of 256, or add `launchctl limit maxfiles 2048 2048 ` to `.bashrc`
or `.zshrc`. See [https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-watch#how-do-i-fix-the-error-emfile-too-many-opened-files](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-watch#how-do-i-fix-the-error-emfile-too-many-opened-files)
for further details.

**Note:** On OSX, you may also see an error about *Allow dev_appserver to check
for updates on startup? (Y/n)* and, many lines below it, *EOFError: EOF when
reading a line*. If so you need to run dev_appserver once in a GAE project to
allow `dev_appserver` to ask you about checking for updates. Choose whichever
answer you like; this just clears the prompt for future runs of `dev_appserver`
and you should be good to go.


Running the site
================

With Docker (recommended)
-------------------------

Prefixing a command with `tools/docker.sh` will run it inside the Docker container,
which includes all the dependencies needed to build the site.


Build the project:

```sh
tools/docker.sh grunt build
```

Run a local dev server:

```sh
tools/docker.sh grunt develop
```
Then point your browser to http://localhost:8081/web/fundamentals or the
IP address of your Docker instance

To build only a single language *FASTER*:

```sh
tools/docker.sh grunt develop --lang=en
```

Using boot2docker and Mac OS X
==============================

After running ``tools/docker.sh grunt develop``, the Web Fundamentals 
website will be running on your local Docker instance.
However, to view the website from a browser, you need to get the 
IP address of **boot2docker** (NOT your Docker instance):

```sh
$ boot2docker ip
192.168.59.103
```

From this IP you can access the website.

```
http://192.168.59.103:8081/web/fundamentals
```

Without Docker
--------------

Once you have all the dependencies installed go to the root of the checked out repo and type:

```
grunt develop
```

This will have Jekyll build the site, run a static server to listen on
port 8081 (which you can now reach at
[http://localhost:8081/web/fundamentals/](http://localhost:8081/web/fundamentals/)),
and watch for changes to site files. Every change will cause Jekyll to rebuild
the affected files.

If you want to build a single language then run this: `grunt develop --lang=en`.



Using project-level meta data
=============================

The table of contents is generated from `src/_project.yaml`

To parse the `_project.yaml` file, include `{% injectdata content _project.yaml %}` in the page. You then have access to the variables in the page object.


Generating Table of Contents
----------------------------

The table of contents is generated from `src/_book.yaml`

To parse the `_book.yaml` file, include `{% injectdata content _book.yaml %}` in the page and then iterate as follows:

     {% for section in page.content.toc %}
        SOME MARKUP
     {% endfor %}

Jekyll Special elements
-----------------------

* Code import: `{% highlight javascript %} {% include sample1.js %} {% endhighlight %}`
* `{{ articles _category_}}` a list of articles in divs, ordered by the "order" preamble.
* `{{ showcases _category_}}` a list of showcases.
