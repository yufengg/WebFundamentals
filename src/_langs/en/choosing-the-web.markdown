This guide explores why you would choose the web and walks through some unique user-facing abilities and features the open web provides.

## Everywhere

**Build once, be on all platforms and devices.**

Do you want your app to be everywhere? The web is everywhere. No, *really*. 
It’s available in almost every country of the world. It’s on TVs, PCs,
laptops, smartphones, smartwatches, tablets, refrigerators and toasters. OK,
maybe not toasters, but you get the point.

Building for the web means building across operating systems and devices.  While
there are always browser differences, device differences, and UI considerations,
the same set of developers can handle the workload for all of them, making the
entire development cycle much less expensive. Hiring individual talent for each
platform is much more risky and difficult, and porting apps to multiple
programming languages is a lengthy maintenance nightmare.

## Searchable

**Deep indexing of your content opens entry points from search engines.**

While native apps currently provide more discoverability than the web through
custom app stores, the web has an unbeatable ability to be *found*, especially
if your site is content heavy. Provided that your site is freely accessible,
search engines index all of the content within your app or site and make it
available for their users. The more content and sub pages, the more doors open
for your visitors. A native app usually only has a single point of entry.

## Always up to date

**Web apps and sites are remotely hosted and up to date for 100% of your visitors by default.**

By default, a web site or web app is *always* up to date. You're able to choose
how often you roll out updates and to whom you roll out new features. Updates
happen transparently to the user without requiring explicit approvals. This makes
A/B testing of new versions trivial. But most importantly it makes getting 100%
of your users upgraded to the latest and hottest an actual reality.

In contrast, native apps are bound to update delays and reviews that
often take up to two weeks, depending on the vendor. When the update
arrives, installation often requires the explicit agreement of the user.

It’s no coincidence that many news sites embrace the mobile web. If your app
demands to be fresh at all times for all of your users, choose the web.

## Instant load

**The web can deliver apps and sites that are preloaded in less than a second.**

While it is difficult to build native apps that stream and lazy-load content and
logic when needed, web apps and sites are naturally able to amend their logic
and content after the initial page load. Only the web platform gives you the
ability to create the impression of an instant load.

As web apps don’t have to be distributed in a single container, it’s perfectly
valid to preload the first visible content and make it available to the user
in less than a second, then lazy-load the rest of it without the users
awareness. While performance during runtime is a different topic, the web
cannot be beaten if your goal is the immediate availability of your app.

## Independent

**The web does not censor content or disallow different payment providers and is an even playing field for all.**

Corporate controlled App Stores, for all their advantages, come with strings
attached. Their offerings are controlled and shaped to match the culture of
the platform organization, thus excluding or severely restricting whole
categories of apps that are perfectly legal but not wanted. Other restrictions
can apply when your app competes with a OS provided app or when your app wants to
use a different payment provider. The App Store's approval process is
often a black box and there is little room for discussion or dealing with
ambiguously rejected apps.

To be truly independent and free of fear of censorship, you have to embrace
the open web. If you are building an adult entertainment or file sharing app,
or prefer PayPal as payment method, go web.

## Ephemeral

**Clicking on a link is effortless compared to installing a native app.**

Web apps and sites open with a single click, and with the implicit guarantee to
the visitor that nothing terribly bad will happen.  Native apps in comparison
need to be installed, a conscious process that involves friction (click
throughs, heavy download sizes, passwords), and often constant risk assessment
from the user.

The point of entry for web sites and apps is entirely effortless. This is
important for more than security reasons. What if your app is only needed twice
a year? Even if you get somebody to install these types of apps, the stickyness
of the home screen isn’t any help. Studies show that there’s a clear upper limit
for individual app usage per month. If your app is used less often, it'll be
forgotten quickly after it's installed. Instead, what if your app were only a
Google search away, instantly available when users need it, and gone when they
don’t?

Finally, installation-free also means risk-free tryouts. Few native app stores
offer the ability to give what the web offers by default: the ability to try an
app before bying it.

## Viral

**The web has the best sharing mechanism in the world, built in.**

Why are social games so much more popular than native games? There’s a powerful
messaging concept built into the web: Hyperlinks!  Link sharing and multiple
entry points open social games to the posiblity of going viral.

Sure, you could share achievements out to Facebook or Twitter from an Xbox
game, but there’s a gap. How does the person who sees your share get into the
game? If it was built on the open web, all she would literally have to do is
click on the provided link.

What if shareable interactions are part of the game itself? For example, within
a trivia app you could forward individual questions as links to your followers
on Twitter. Your followers could answer the questions and get hooked on the game
without installing anything. We can likely agree that this has more impact than
a link to a native app or a link to an ad for console game.

Of course, all of this applies to more than just games. Almost all web apps
and sites profit from links that interconnect them and make the web flow.

## Long lasting

**Your web app will still run 20 years from now, even if you abandon its development.**

Native platform providers boast about the new features they add every year when
compared to the web. They conveniently fail to mention that it's a lack of
standardization that allows them to do this. Corporate platforms come and go and
rarely last longer than a decade.

The web is built for the long haul. Through the standardization of the W3C, the
brightest minds in the world are making sure that the platform you built on is
rock solid, consistent, and well supported. This means that the foundation of
knowledge, code, and talent you build today will remain relevant in the future.

More importantly, it means that your users will probably be able to use your
site 20 years from now, even if you abandon its active development.  The same
cannot be claimed for native platforms.
