## What are the Public and Private Key Pairs?

A **public/private key pair** is a pair of very large numbers that can be used
as encryption keys and decryption keys, and which share a special mathematical
relationship. A common system for key pairs is the **[RSA
cryptosystem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem))**. The **public
key** is used to encrypt messages, and the messages can only be feasibly
decrypted with the corresponding **private key**. Your web server will advertise
its public key to the world, and clients (such as web browsers) will use that to
bootstrap a secure channel to your server.

## What is a Certificate Authority?

A **certification authority (CA)** is an organization that vouches for the
mapping between public keys and public DNS names (such as "www.foobar.com").
For example, how is a client to know if a particular public key is the _true_
public key for www.foobar.com? A priori, there is no way to know. A CA vouches
for a particular key as being the true one for a particular site by using its
own private key to **[cryptographically
sign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)#Signing_messages)** the
web site's public key. This signature is computationally infeasible to forge.
Browsers (and other clients) maintain **trust anchor stores** containing the
public keys owned by the well-known CAs, and they use those public keys to
**cryptographically verify** the CA's signatures.

An **X.509 certificate** is a data format that bundles a public key together
with some metadata about the entity that owns the key. In the case of the web,
the owner of the key is the site operator, and the important metadata is the DNS
name of the web server. When a client connects to an HTTPS web server, the web
server presents its certificate for the client to verify. The client verifies
that the certificate has not expired, that the DNS name matches the name of the
server the client was trying to connect to, and that a known trust anchor CA has
signed the certificate. In most cases, CAs do not directly sign web server
certificates; usually, there is a **chain of certificates** linking a trust
anchor, to an intermediate signer or signers, and finally to the web server's
own certificate (the **end entity**).

## What is a Certificate Signing Request?

A **certificate signing request (CSR)** is a data format that, like a
certificate, bundles a public key together with some metadata about the entity
that owns the key. However, clients do not interpret CSRs; CAs do. When you seek
to have a CA vouch for your web server's public key, you send the CA a CSR. The
CA validates the information in the CSR, and uses it to generate a certificate.
They then send you the final certificate, and you install that certificate (or,
more likely, a certificate chain) and your private key on your web server.
