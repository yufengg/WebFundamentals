Set &lt;link rel="canonical" href="https://â€¦"/&gt; tags in your pages. [This

know the best way to get to your site.

Most web servers offer a simple redirect feature. Use 301 (Moved Permanently) to
indicate to search engines and browsers that the HTTPS version is canonical and redirect your users to the HTTPS version of your site from HTTP.
