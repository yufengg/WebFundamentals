Performance matters to users. Web developers need to build apps that react 
quickly and render smoothly.

Google performance guru Paul Lewis is here to help you destroy jank and create
web apps that maintain 60 frames per second performance.

You'll leave this course with the tools you need to profile apps and identify
the causes of jank. You'll explore the browser's rendering pipeline and uncover
patterns that make it easy to build performant apps.
