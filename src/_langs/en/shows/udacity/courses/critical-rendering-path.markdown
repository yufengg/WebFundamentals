You will learn how to optimize any website for speed by diving into the details
of how mobile and desktop browsers render pages.

In this short course, you’ll learn about the Critical Rendering Path, or the set
of steps browsers must take to convert HTML, CSS and JavaScript into living,
breathing websites. From there, you’ll start exploring and experimenting with
tools to measure performance and simple strategies to deliver the first pixels
to the screen as early as possible. You’ll learn how to dive into
recommendations from PageSpeed Insights and the Timeline view of Google
Chrome’s Developer Tools to find the data you need to achieve immediate
performance boosts!
