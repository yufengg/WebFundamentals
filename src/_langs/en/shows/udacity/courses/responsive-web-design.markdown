In this course you'll learn the fundamentals of responsive web design with
Google's Pete LePage! You'll create your own responsive web page that works
well on any device - phone, tablet, desktop or anything in between.

You’ll start by exploring what makes a site responsive and how some common
responsive design patterns work across different devices. From there, you’ll
learn how to create your own responsive layout using the viewport tag and CSS
media queries. As you proceed, you’ll experiment with major and minor
breakpoints, and optimizing text for reading.
