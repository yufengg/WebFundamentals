Freshdesk has implemented 'call center'-like capabilities as part of their customer experience management SaaS solution. This integration enables an 'agent' to provide telephony support while utilizing Freskdesk tools to solve the end user's issue with no need for a traditional desktop telephone.

This session is from an afternoon of talks by WebRTC experts, including updates from Google, Mozilla and Microsoft. The event took place at the Google office in San Francisco. More details at http://krankygeek.com.
