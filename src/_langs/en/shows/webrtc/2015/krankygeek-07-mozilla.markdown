WebRTC allows the sharing of screen content â€” Mozilla has some cool demos to share which highlight the power of WebRTC beyond the typical voice/video communications that we typically think of. Nils Ohlmeier also gives an update on the continued progress of Firefox with WebRTC.

This session is from an afternoon of talks by WebRTC experts, including updates from Google, Mozilla and Microsoft. The event took place at the Google office in San Francisco. More details at http://krankygeek.com.
