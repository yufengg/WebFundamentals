OK â€” the demo works. Now how do you build a reliable WebRTC service that scales? Amitha Pulijala, Senior Principal Product Manager at Oracle, talks about techniques to ensure reliability when dealing with WebRTC media and describes how to architect scalable infrastructure from Day 1.

This session is from an afternoon of talks by WebRTC experts, including updates from Google, Mozilla and Microsoft. The event took place at the Google office in San Francisco. More details at http://krankygeek.com.
