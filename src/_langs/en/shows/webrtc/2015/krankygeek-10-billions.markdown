Let's learn from the mistakes and best practices of others. Philipp Hancke of &yet (aka @fippo) explains his extensive reverse engineering of major WebRTC and non-WebRTC VoIP services and shares highlights of what to replicate and what to avoid.

This session is from an afternoon of talks by WebRTC experts, including updates from Google, Mozilla and Microsoft. The event took place at the Google office in San Francisco. More details at http://krankygeek.com.
