  dom-styles:
    - Inspect and edit on the fly any element in the DOM tree in the Elements panel.
    - View and change the CSS rules applied to any selected element in the Styles pane.
    - View and edit a selected element's box model in the Metrics pane.
    - View any changes made to your page locally in the Sources panel.
remember:
  current-tree:
    - The DOM tree view shows the current state of the tree; it may not match the HTML that was originally loaded for different reasons. For example, you can modify the DOM tree using JavaScript; the browser engine can try to correct invalid author markup and produce an unexpected DOM.

## How to inspect a page

Use the **Elements panel** to inspect all elements in your page in one DOM tree. Select any element and inspect the styles applied to it.

{% animation animations/inspect-element.mp4 %}

### Inspect an element

There are several ways to inspect an element:

* Right-click any element on the page the page and select **Inspect Element**.
* Press <kbd class="kbd">Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd class="kbd">Shift</kbd>+<kbd class="kbd">C</kbd> (or <kbd class="kbd">Cmd</kbd>+<kbd class="kbd">Shift</kbd>+<kbd class="kbd">C</kbd> on Mac) to open DevTools in Inspect Element mode, then click on an element.
* Click the **Inspect Element button** ![Inspect icon](imgs/inspect-icon.png){:.inline} at the top of the DevTools window to go into Inspect Element Mode, then click on an element.
* Use the `inspect()` method in the console, such as `inspect(document.body)`. See the [Command Line API Reference](/web/tools/javascript/command-line/command-line-reference) for information on using inspect.

### Inspect styles applied to an element

The Styles pane shows the CSS rules that apply to the selected element, from highest priority to lowest:

* Element styles applied directly to the element using the style property (or applied in DevTools).
* Matched CSS rules include any rules matched by the element. For example, the CSS selector `span` matches an HTML `<span>` element.
* Inherited styles include any inheritable style rules that match the selected element's ancestors.

The labels on the image below correspond with the numbered items below.

![Annotated Styles pane](imgs/styles-annotated.png)

1. Styles associated with a selector that matches the element.
2. **Cascade** rules dictate that if two rules have the same origin, weight, and specificity, the last defined rule takes precedence. In this case, the second color property takes precedence. The first color property is shown in strikethrough text to show that it's been overridden.
3. [User agent stylesheets](http://meiert.com/en/blog/20070922/user-agent-style-sheets/) are clearly labelled, and are often overridden by the CSS on your web page.
4. The **cascade** dictates that author styles have more weight than user agent styles, so the user-defined style of `display: inline-block;` overrides the user-agent defined style of `display: block`.
5. **Inherited** styles are displayed as a group under the "Inherited from [node]" header. Click the DOM node in the header to navigate to its position in the DOM tree view. (The [CSS 2.1 properties table](http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/propidx.html) shows which properties are inheritable.)
6. The selector `:root body` has a higher **specificity** than just `body`, therefore its style declarations take precedence.
7. `font-family` on the body is **overridden**. It is also a similar case for the `font-size` property (overridden due to [selector specificity](http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-selectors/#specificity)).

Understanding how cascading and inheritance works is essential to debugging your styles. The cascade relates to how CSS declarations are given weights to determine which rules should take precedence when they overlap with another rule. Inheritance relates to how HTML elements inherit CSS properties from their containing elements (ancestors). For more, see [W3C documentation on cascading](http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/cascade.html).

## How to live-edit a DOM node

To live-edit a DOM node, simply double-click a [selected element](#inspect-an-element) and make changes:

{% animation animations/edit-element-name.mp4 %}

{% include modules/remember.liquid title="Note" list=page.remember.current-tree %}

{% include modules/related_guides.liquid inline=true list=page.related-guides.edit-dom %}

## How to live-edit a style

Live-edit styles within the **Styles pane** in the Elements panel. Unless the area containing the styling information is greyed out (as is the case with user agent stylesheets), all styles are editable.

To edit a property name, click on it, edit, and press Tab or Enter: ![Edit property name](imgs/image_20.png){:.inline}

To edit the property's value, click on that value, edit, and press Tab or Enter: ![Edit property value](imgs/image_21.png){:.inline} 

By default, your CSS modifications are not permanent, changes are lost when you reload the page.
We recommend [setting up persistent authoring](/web/tools/setup/workspace/setup-workflow) so your changes aren't lost.

{% include modules/related_guides.liquid inline=true list=page.related-guides.edit-styles %}

## Visualize an element's box model parameters

Examine and edit the current element's box model parameters using the Metrics pane.
The Metrics pane resides just below the Styles pane.

The concentric rectangles contain the values for the **padding**, **border**, and **margin** properties (top, right, bottom, and left values for each of them.)

For non-statically positioned elements, a **position** rectangle will be additionally displayed in the pane, containing the values of the **top**, **right**, **bottom**, and **left** properties.

![Metrics pane](imgs/metrics.png)

For `position: fixed` and `position: absolute` elements, the central field contains the actual **offsetWidth Ã— offsetHeight** pixel dimensions of the selected element.
All values can be modified by double-clicking them, like property values in the Styles pane (the changes are not, however, guaranteed to take effect, as this is subject to the concrete element positioning specifics.)

## View local changes

To view a history of live-edits made to your page:

* Open the **Sources** panel.
* Right-click **Ctrl + Click** on a source file in the sidebar.
* Select **Local modifications**.

To explore the changes made:

* Expand top-level file names to view the time ![time modification occurred](imgs/image_25.png){:.inline} a modification occurred.
* Expand second-level items to view a [diff](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diff) (before and after) corresponding to the modification. A line with a pink background signifies a removal while a line with a green background signifies an addition.

{% animation animations/revisions.mp4 %}

## Undo changes

If you haven't [set up persistent authoring](/web/tools/setup/workspace/setup-workflow), any time you reload the page, all live-edits are lost.

Assuming you've set up persistent authoring, to undo changes:

* Use <kbd class="kbd">Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd class="kbd">Z</kbd> (or <kbd class="kbd">Cmd</kbd>+<kbd class="kbd">Z</kbd> on Mac) to quickly undo minor changes to the DOM or styles via the Elements panel.

* To undo all local modifications made to a file, open the **Sources** panel and select **revert** next to the filename.
