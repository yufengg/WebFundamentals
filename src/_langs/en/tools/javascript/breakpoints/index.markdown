As you develop your web page,
you will want to locate and correct bugs in your JavaScript.
But in an executing script,
the erroneous code will almost certainly be processed
before you can identify it.

Pause running JavaScript at various points
so you can determine its progress or examine its variable values.
Chrome DevTools breakpoints let you pause your code
without having to use brute-force statements
such as `alert("ok so far")` or `alert("x = " + x)`.
