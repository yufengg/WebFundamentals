If you have trouble trying to read and debug minified JavaScript in the DevTools, a pretty printing option is available to make life easier. 

Here is how a minified script displayed in the tools might look prior to being displayed in the DevTools:

By clicking the curly braces ![Pretty print icon](imgs/prettyprint-icon.png){:.inline} icon in the bottom left corner, the JavaScript is transformed into a more human readable form. This is also easier for debugging and setting breakpoints.
