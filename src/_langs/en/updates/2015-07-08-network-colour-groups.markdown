Get a simple overview of resource types in the Network panel with the <em>Color-code resource types</em> feature. To enable (if not already)

<ol>
<li>Go to Settings (the cog wheel)</li>
<li>In the general section, find the network heading.</li>
<li>Check <em>Color-code resource types</em>.</li>
</ol>

Each of Scripts, Stylesheets, documents, fonts and more will be coloured based on its type so you can easily understand what you're looking at without having to read the filename.
