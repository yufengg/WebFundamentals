Use the <em>Media Query Inspector</em> to inspect and trigger the registered breakpoints on a page. In Device Mode, click the icon which looks like <em>staggered bars</em> in the upper left corner of the page, the MQI opens.

You can trigger the various breakpoints with a click on a bar. If you right click on a bar, you can reveal its position within the source code.
