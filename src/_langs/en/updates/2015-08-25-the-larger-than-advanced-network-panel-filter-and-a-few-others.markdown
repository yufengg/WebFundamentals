Use the Advanced Network Panel Filtering feature to narrow down resources to exactly what you want to find. For example:

<ul>
<li>
<code>larger-than:100</code> will find and filter for resources larger than 100 bytes</li>
<li>You can negate a query by prepending a '-' to it. E.g. <code>-larger-than:50k</code> to find resources which are <em>not</em> larger than 50k.</li>
<li>
<code>status-code:200</code> to find resources with a status code response of <code>200</code>.</li>
</ul>

A few other queries which you can experiment with:

<ul>
<li>domain</li>
<li>mime-type</li>
<li>scheme</li>
<li>set-cookie-domain</li>
<li>set-cookie-value</li>
<li>has-response-header</li>
</ul>

Note: you get autocomplete for these, it makes it easier to discover query types and their corresponding values. The values which autocomplete will exist in your current network recording.
